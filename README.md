Dearest project reviewer,

Thank you for taking the time to review my barebones version of the Motion Planning project for Udacity 
Flying Car Nanodegree.  This project is barebones only due to timing for project submission.  I have full 
intentions of revisiting every point and creating a smooth and beautiful algorithm as my skills imporove.

I named all of the important files with the preceding "wwiest_" to set them apart from the originals.  
You will find the links to the neccesary files below.

#### [Starter Code Explainer](https://github.com/woodrowwiest/FCND-Motion-Planning/blob/master/wwiest_starter_code_explainer.md)
#### [Writeup](https://github.com/woodrowwiest/FCND-Motion-Planning/blob/master/wwiest_writeup.md)
#### [Motion_Planning](https://github.com/woodrowwiest/FCND-Motion-Planning/blob/master/wwiest_motion_planning.py)
#### [Planning_Utils](https://github.com/woodrowwiest/FCND-Motion-Planning/blob/master/wwiest_planning_utils.py)

Of course they all exist right here on my GitHub (https://github.com/woodrowwiest/FCND-Motion-Planning)

Thanks again!\
Woodrow
